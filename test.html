        <h2>Introduction to Web Applications</h2>
        <p>A web application is a software application that runs on a web server, unlike traditional desktop applications, which are launched by your operating system. Web applications are accessed through a web browser with an active internet connection.</p>
        <p>Examples of web applications include Gmail, Amazon, Facebook, and Google Docs.</p>

        <h2>Components of Web Applications</h2>
        <img src="images/web_app_structure.png" alt="Web Application Structure">
        <h3>Front-end (client-side)</h3>
        <p>The front-end is the part of the web application that interacts with the user. It includes everything the user experiences: design, layout, text, images, and user interaction.</p>

        <h3>Back-end (server-side)</h3>
        <p>The back-end handles business logic, database interactions, user authentication, etc. It consists of the server, database, and application logic.</p>

        <h3>Database</h3>
        <p>The database is the organized collection of data. It can be relational (SQL) or non-relational (NoSQL).</p>

    <section>
        <h2>Interaction between Front-End and Back-End</h2>
        <p>When a user interacts with a web application (e.g., submits a form), the front-end sends an HTTP request to the back-end. The back-end processes this request, interacts with the database if necessary, and sends back an HTTP response.</p>
        <p><strong>HTTP Methods:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>GET:</strong> Retrieve data</li>
            <li><strong>POST:</strong> Submit data</li>
            <li><strong>PUT:</strong> Update data</li>
            <li><strong>DELETE:</strong> Remove data</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>APIs:</strong> APIs are sets of rules that allow different software entities to communicate with each other. Web APIs enable the interaction between the front-end and back-end.</p>

        <h2>Role of Databases in Web Applications</h2>
        <p>Databases play a crucial role in web applications by storing, retrieving, updating, and deleting data. They ensure data security and integrity.</p>
        <p><strong>Types of Databases:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>SQL Databases:</strong> Structured data, uses queries (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL)</li>
            <li><strong>NoSQL Databases:</strong> Unstructured data, flexible schemas (e.g., MongoDB, Redis)</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Operations:</strong> CRUD Operations - Create, Read, Update, Delete</p>
    </section>

        <h2>Benefits of Web Applications</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Accessibility: Accessible from any device with a web browser.</li>
            <li>Cross-Platform Compatibility: Works on various operating systems.</li>
            <li>Centralized Data Management: Data is stored centrally, making it easier to manage and secure.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Future Trends in Web Applications</h2>
        <p>Emerging trends include AI and machine learning integration, progressive web apps (PWAs), and enhanced user experiences with new technologies.</p>
